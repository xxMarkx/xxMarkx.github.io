ATM was my first pick for a elective. Whe nI went on a field trip in elementary, me and my friends were so happy because we all wanted to go to bancroft.
When we got there we got to see the ATM program. We all wanted to do the program. After when into middle schools we all got in to ATM and we were in the same class.
I love ATM because when I got in to seven grade we used photoshop. Photoshop was like a hole new thing that you can make anything you want.
For every student in one Atm program we switch to a different teacher. Her name was Ms Miltion, we worked on sketchup and code. 
But now in eight grade we work on dash and more code. After two semeters we switch back to Ms Mclure.

In photoshop I loved the things I could work on. The things that you imagine that can become true if you work hard and don't give up.
When I made this it was one of the hardest things I made. Like finding the images and making the gardiants. 
I love this one because I love the UK and the feel of being there and the awesome places there. I love the Uk on the places there and to see.
